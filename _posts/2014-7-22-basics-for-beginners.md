##So here we are

Despite the helpful efforts of countless programmers far more skilled than I, somehow I screwed things up on every step of the way up to this point. But in the end, here we are. 

My name is Patrick, and this is a blog. I'm learning all sorts of wonderful things along the way. Examples: proper use of grammar, an abridged history of emo music, and discovering my woeful inadequacy with CSS. But we'll keep moving along.

I expect a lot of things to change as I start to actually understand what I'm doing. But hey, that's the fun part, right?

Here's to learning and growing, and to the next great adventure.
