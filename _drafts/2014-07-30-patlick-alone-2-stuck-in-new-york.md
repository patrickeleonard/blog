It's been a busy week. I drove a lot.

I presently find myself on a weird commuter train from New Jersey, somehow the land of my birth, toward New York City for a few days.

# Blogposts that never were:

**Cleveland Ain't So Bad** in which I work for an MLB team vicariously through my successful friend for a couple days.

**900 miles later** in which I receive a phone call from my mom in West Virginia and take an ensuing 3-hour detour into the corner of Tennessee.

**A classic baseball move** in which the Mariners lose 1-0 in Baltimore while people asked us why we were ridiculous enough to wear flannel to a ballpark in this weather.

**Hoboken is the hot new place for young people** in which living on the water in New Jersey is fun and kind of water sportsy, and people from NYC scoff at this apparently asinine concept.

# Additional thoughts:

- Holy shit, these headings are ridiculous. Gotta change that.

- There should totally be a version ot Twitter for things like blogposts, that limits you to one paragraph or something instead of 140 characters.

- I need to write more songs.

- I need to edit the songs we already wrote.

- Need more time. Always more time.

- I find driving to be extremely therapeutic, but every time I mention that to people they just look at me like I'm crazy. 900 mile days alone aren't THAT bad, are they?

- On a related note: I might be crazy.
