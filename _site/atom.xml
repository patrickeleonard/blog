&lt;h3 id=&quot;im-currently-on-about-my-8th-playthrough&quot;&gt;I’m currently on about my 8th playthrough…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…of &lt;em&gt;Kintsugi&lt;/em&gt;, the latest album by my inner teenage girl’s favorite band, Death Cab for Cutie. And, surprisingly, it’s been growing on me, but not for the reasons I imagined it would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be perfectly honest, I really wanted to hate this album. Their previous effort, 2011’s &lt;em&gt;Codes and Keys&lt;/em&gt;, was definitely a step down from their older stuff. It felt hollow and unrelatable, as if even Ben Gibbard himself didn’t believe in the songs he was writing. I expected &lt;em&gt;Kintsugi&lt;/em&gt; to be similar, another sign that the band peaked in 2005 and has since run out of things to say. Instead we got an album that feels not quite like a return to form, but a return to inspiration. It’s older and more mature, but it doesn’t suck. And I think at this point it’s safe to say that in a weird, grown-up way, I kind of like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aqueduct had a song in the mid-2000s called “Growing Up With GNR” that touches on themes of getting older, feeling out of place, and connecting certain songs or bands to moments or phases in your life. I can sympathize with Aqueduct’s David Terry, but in this case Death Cab is my GNR and Ben Gibbard is my Axl Rose. Death Cab soundtracked my adolescence. &lt;em&gt;Plans&lt;/em&gt; was my gateway to indie rock in 8th grade. They were my first concert without my parents. I drove to the record store to buy &lt;em&gt;Narrow Stairs&lt;/em&gt; on its release day. I’ve played &lt;em&gt;The Photo Album&lt;/em&gt; on the piano, start to finish, and I’ve cried on couches to “Tiny Vessels” after a breakup. A friend and I journeyed to Victoria last summer for their final show with Chris Walla. There is no band in the world that means as much to me, personally and culturally, as Death Cab for Cutie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first couple times I listened to &lt;em&gt;Kintsugi&lt;/em&gt;, it didn’t feel right. But over time I realized that the problem wasn’t them, it was me. Death Cab have grown a lot over the years, but my ideal of them hasn’t. I wanted them to forever remain the same band I fell in love with in 8th grade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong - I don’t like this album as much as some of their others, but it’s still a solid effort. I think the guitar work is some of their best to date, and at times the songwriting feels as sharp as it ever did. But Death Cab has most certainly grown up, and I’m finally learning to grow up with them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Quick Jaunt To Oklahoma</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I took a trip with Ed Ingerman, a dear friend and former roommate, to Oklahoma for no particular reason than to say I’d been to Oklahoma. Driving that far south in July is about as batshit ridiculous as ideas come these days, so naturally Ed and I were the perfect team for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, frankly, too hot to even consider writing about this particular endeavor. So, unable to join together multiple coherent thoughts at a time, I started coming up with a collection of possible subtitles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…in which I lose a fistful of electrolytes and then OD on Gatorade&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…in which not having AC in the car provides our protagonist with his first “I’ve made a huge mistake” moment&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…in which I take “car camping” to mean “camping inside your actual car because who needs tents and HOLY SHIT I NEED TO SLEEP LITERALLY ANYWHERE BUT INSIDE THIS CAR”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas were my 43rd, 44th, and 45th states of the union, which is pretty cool. Hopefully the worst is behind us now and states 46-50 will be less… swampy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quote of the weekend:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey Patrick, this campsite (and by campsite we mean an abandoned parking lot in northern Oklahoma) is really sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Ed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till next time, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pictures&quot;&gt;Pictures!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Underexposed sunset, coincidentally the best photograph of the weekend: (photo credit to Ed)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2014-07-28-a-quick-jaunt-to-oklahoma/sunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Illinois State Capitol selfie: the only one in which we somehow don’t both look complete goobers:&lt;/em&gt;

   <title>Basics For Beginners</title>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-here-we-are&quot;&gt;So here we are&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the helpful efforts of countless programmers far more skilled than I, somehow I screwed things up on every step of the way up to this point. But in the end, here we are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Patrick, and this is a blog. I’m learning all sorts of wonderful things along the way. Examples: proper use of grammar, an abridged history of emo music, and discovering my woeful inadequacy with CSS. But we’ll keep moving along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect a lot of things to change as I start to actually understand what I’m doing. But hey, that’s the fun part, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to learning and growing, and to the next great adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
